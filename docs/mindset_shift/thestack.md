# The Stack
One of the most core conceptual differences with Spaz is that everything is done via a stack.

A stack is a foundational data structure in computer science that has a wide variety of use cases. In Spaz's case it is used as a sort of `runtime stack`. All operations, procedure calls, control flow, etc. is done using the data currently on the stack.

A stack works in a LIFO manner. This means that the last item to be pushed onto the stack is the first item to popped off.
