# Inspiration

Spaz is a language that owes its existence to [@Tsoding](https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding), and his [Porth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4) youtube series.

Without him and his dedication to Porth, I may have never gotten interested in languages and their implementations. So thank you, Tsoding.

Porth heavily inspired Spaz in the sense that it is a stack based language
